# Features

**Navigation:**

- In the navigation menu located in the header of the page the user can find links to a Contact page and a Get involved page. When clicked, they are directed to a new page, where the links displayed in the header are updated to easily accesss the Home page again.
- In the Aside bar at the right top corner of the index page multiple links within the page are listed so the user can easily access all information avaliable at the page.


**Header:**

- The Header displays the name of the website with a chosen icon from font-awesome on the left and links to other 2 pages on the right. A dark military inspired green was chosen as background color with a contrast of a light beige.

**Main section:**

- The main section is composed of an article with an aside. The article contains all major information about Armistice Day and is composed of a header, a figure and 3 different sections. All sections are linked in the aside box for easier access.
- The Article is separated into 3 different topics: Armistice Day, Remembrance Day and Common Symbols Associated. It contains a summary of each topic, a list containing the countries that celebrate it and  appropriate image for each symbol chosen.
- The aside box has a slightly lighter beige tone as background color so it can dinstinct itself from the main content without looking out of place.

**Get Involved page:**

- In the navigation menu at the top of the home page the user can find a link to the Get Involved page where two different links as well as a small paragraph can be found. 
- The 2 Donation links are displayed in a box style with an image and a small complementary text under. The same lighter tone of beige used in the aside is used as background for each box to maintain the overall aesthetic of the website.
- The two different links direct the user to external pages. The first one to the donations section of the Royal British Legion Website and the second one to a donation form for the Bleuet de France movement.

# Testing 

**Browser testing**

- The project was created based on google chrome but functions just as well (although the font changes slightly) on Safari and Firefox.
- The project is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

**Bugs and Debugging**

- During most of the process the CSS file broke several times despite all the file path being done correctly.
- The file directory presented issues nesting folders and accessing HTML files. Issues were fixed on debugging by adding "/" when attributing Hyperlinks.
- The anchor tag inside line 105 was shown as an error on the W3c validator but no solution was found.

**Validator Testing**

- The HTML code for the Get Involved page and Contact passed the official W3C validator but the index presented Error on line 105. Unfortunetly a solution for the error was not found while debugging.
